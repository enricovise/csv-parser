CSV file reader, (can't use any libraries or language tokenizer) i.e.
we want to see real parsing code. Should be able to read a file and ask
for a given line and element. In addition you should be able to ask for
an elements as an Integer / Double / String / Date (don't worry about
the last one if you don't have enough time).
